You get 6 days off per month, if you work 6 days a week (of which one day is blocked off for (self-)maintenance tasks, i.e. not making progress on your goal). To get a full 21 days of work in, you need 3 more days from the 4th week (total 28 days). This means 4 days off in the 4th week plus 2 more (= 6 days off per month) because the month is  30/31 days.  

If you want to save your days off for a real holiday at the end of the 90 days, just start with the next 21 day template. To get around the problem that each 21 day session normally starts on a Monday, just start adding the rest of this week to the next template's last week which is completely undated.
