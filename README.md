# Planner and Habit Tracker Template
A template to help you create your own custom daily planner or habit tracking system.
Depending on what you need from it, just print selected pages. For example, if you wanted to use the weekly templates together with the monthly overview, you will want to print the weekly overview for each week of the month and so on.  

But the main purpose of this being a LaTeX template is, of course, that you can customize it to fit your own needs!

# Description

It features:
* **A weekly tracker in landscape mode.** This weekly template isn't a planner and probably won't replace yours either. You could possibly try but there isn't tons of room for appointments. Might work out if you print it out on an A3 paper or you don't have lots of appointments. Its purpose is more like a tracker for habits and routines. It asks you to note down your daily highlight, has 3 mini journaling prompts, icons for daily tracking. You can interpret the icons liberally to easily track some daily habits. Add ones you like from the `fontawesome` package, remove the ones you don't like.  The boxes in the middle symbolize a morning routine / work startup routine, the other hours of your day blocked in to two 2-3h boxes. Because the idea is that you can't realistically do more than two big tasks in a day, so the template doesn't even give you the choice ;) The last box is a work winddown routine which you should use to check off some of the todos from your email, admin task and guilt hour lists from your weekly overview. That one consciously only has 3 items per category so you're not tempted to spend all your week on admin tasks while conveniantly ignoring / procrastinating on your actual goals. To track whether you did the morning or evening routine, you can for example colour in the boxes you completed, so you'll have a quick overview of wether you're actually doing the routines or not. Oh and there are also little symbols where you can check your energy in the morning and evening, as well as your mood at some point. This might help you spot some patterns, like which types of tasks cause you to end up really drained at the end of the day. 
* **Weekly Review** Print the Weekly Review onto the other side of the page to have all your week in one sheet of paper. Add some prompts of your owm and remove the ones you don't like. Print it out in A3 paper size if you find it too small on A4 or letter paper. Or use the small paper size as a reminder to not write too much.
* **A printout for a monthly overview for goal tracking and goal setting ** Customize as you like. Set some goals, track some habits and note down achievements for later record. 
* **A page with trackers for 20h skill learning projects** (To learn how it works, check out [`https://first20hours.com/`](https://first20hours.com/)) 
* **A tracking template for your 100 day projects with one overview page and then 10 sections where you can track a 10 day period with a sub-goal or sub-project.** Here you can note the dates when you work on your project and how long you worked on them, or what sub-task you completed or what you learned. I thought this would make it easier not only to track progress but also to record what you did for later reference. 
* **A template for a 21/90 project.** There is a planner which helps you track so called 21/90 projects but I found the planner had too many elements I didn't like. So I thought I'd just LaTeX'ify the part that I liked as a printout. The idea is that you have a 90 day project or allocate 90 days to reach a goal or whatever. Then you split it into three sub-projects. If you take away some days for holidays and breaks then you have 21 days for each subproject. That's it essentially.

How to use:
* print it out. 
* some of the pages are meant to be printed on two sides of the same sheet. 
* add your own notes, best using a pen with a sharp tip. For example like a Pigma Micron 01.
* use a highlight pen for better contrast or visualization.
* also use highlighter to check off boxes as done by colouring them in.

Use the template to make it your own and adopt it to your needs. Or just use it as is-

Print it out, fill it out and maybe share your experiences with it, so we can update it to make it even better :)
